# Weather-Journal Project

## Overview
An asynchronous JavaScript web app that uses OpenWeather API. The user fetches weather data on the client side and stores it server side. Then the data stored in server is requested to update client side UI.

## Instructions
1. Download zip file or clone repository into local machine. 
2. Open folder in a text editor and type "npm install" in terminal to install dependencies. 
3. Run "node server.js" in terminal and open "localhost:300" in browser to use app.

## Credit
Starter code for the HTML and CSS files came from Udacity as part of the Front End Nanodegree. I modified those files to give my own style. Weather API came from OpenWeatherMap.
